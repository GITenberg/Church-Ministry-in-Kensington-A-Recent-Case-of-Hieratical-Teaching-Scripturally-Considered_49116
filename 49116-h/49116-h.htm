<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> Christmas offering to your
former bishop, of Salisbury, to your flock in South Kensington,
and to the public at large, has taken eight months to reach me;
so slowly does literature circulate from end to end of the
ancient parish of Kensington.&nbsp; But I cordially hope that my
present acknowledgments may arrive before Christmas comes again;
for you have chosen an appropriate offering, your own
workmanship, in the shape of Eight carefully-written Sermons,
upon the Sacrifice, Altar, and Priest of the Christian
dispensation.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sacrifice,&rdquo; says the judicious Hooker (Eccl. Pol. v.
78), &ldquo;is now no part of the Church ministry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nevertheless your first position is, that &ldquo;we (clergy) have
this treasure in earthen vessels,&rdquo; and you take the text of
your First Sermon from the words, though not the meaning of S.
Paul (2 Cor. iv. 7), where he writes, not, as you expound (p. 5),
of the treasure of sacerdotal privilege, but of the treasure of
Gospel knowledge; as he speaks elsewhere of the treasures of
knowledge remaining hid in Christ (Col. ii. 3); a passage which
you apply more accurately, as the text of your Eighth
Sermon.&nbsp; You even go so far (p. 40) as to aver that
&ldquo;by Christ&rsquo;s own appointment . . . his very body and
blood are truly offered . . . day by day;&rdquo; though S. Paul
says of Christ, that &ldquo;He needeth not daily to offer up
sacrifices&rdquo; (Heb. vii. 27).&nbsp; Must we then offer
sacrifices without Him?&nbsp; Surely when you remember the same
Apostle pleading for one death, one judgment, and one offering,
as co-ordinate verities (Heb. ix. 27, 28); and declaring that
&ldquo;there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins&rdquo; (Heb. x.
26), you will no longer find a difficulty in &ldquo;admitting it
to be conceivable,&rdquo; (should you not say, certain?)
&ldquo;that it was intended that sacrifice should altogether
cease when the Great Sacrifice was completed&rdquo; (p. 46).</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>The
sacrificial Hebrew language will always repay attention.&nbsp; It
is more subtle and exact, in matters of sin and conscience, than
the Greek; whereon the inspired writers frequently pile a weight
of meaning, to which the latter language is hardly equal.&nbsp;
Hebrew distinguishes sacrifice from sacrifice, sin from
sin.&nbsp; You argue, for instance, in your Second Sermon, that
if Job offered a daily sacrifice, before the coming of the Law,
then Christians also, after the Law, may probably offer the
like.&nbsp; But Job made a sacrifice for sin (Job i. 5), which
was all burnt; we offer nothing for sin, and our oblation is all
eaten.&nbsp; And though the Eucharistic sacrifice of praise might
perhaps have been deemed, as a peace-offering, to be also in some
sense an offering of blood (Lev. vii. 12), yet S. Paul has
carefully obviated the idea.&nbsp; He will not even allow the
venerable reading of the prophetic text (Hos. xiv. 2), which he
quotes (Heb. xiii. 15), <i>pharim</i>, or &ldquo;calves&rdquo; of
our lips, because the blood of beasts must be excluded entirely
from Eucharistic comparisons, and, with blood, all idea of
expiation in the Eucharist.&nbsp; And, therefore, with the LXX.
he reads <i>pheri</i>, &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; of our lips giving
thanks to the name of God.</p>
<p>Rightly, therefore, do you style the Eucharist (p. 124),
&ldquo;the sum and substance of our praises and
thanksgivings;&rdquo; though S. Paul does not go <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>with you in
adding that &ldquo;it is the highest means of applying to our
sins the mercies of God through the ever-availing sacrifice of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; He reserves this pre-eminence to faith (Gal.
v. 5); and faith is actually represented as the sacrificing
priest of the spiritual house by Romanus the martyr of Antioch,
about the beginning of the fourth century, in his dying address,
which Prudentius versifies (Peristephanon x. 351).&nbsp; You will
pardon the rudeness of an old English translation, made in the
days of our Reformation, when heart answered to heart between the
martyrs of earlier and later ages:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At th&rsquo; holy porch a Priest is
standing there,<br />
And keeps the doors, before the church which been;<br />
Faith is her name, a virgin chaste and clear,<br />
Her hair tied up with fillets, like a queen.<br />
For Sacrifices, simple, pure, and clean,<br />
And such she knows are pleasing, bids this Priest<br />
Offer to God, and to his dear Son, Christ.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sacrifices, thereafter described, being such as holy fear,
sound knowledge, sobriety, and liberality.&nbsp; This, you will
say, is declamation, not doctrine.&nbsp; But so is the mass of
Nicene and ante-Nicene material which contradicts Romanus.&nbsp;
If the one pleases you, the other may equally please me.&nbsp;
Let, then, both of us be cautious, consistent, and
scriptural.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>At times
you seem to retreat from your position that the Eucharist is a
true sacrifice, describing it only as &ldquo;the presenting
afresh, and pleading afresh, and causing Christ himself to plead
afresh, the merits of that one precious death&rdquo; (p.
60).&nbsp; Certainly, to commemorate, present, or plead afresh a
sacrifice once offered, is not the same thing as to offer
it.&nbsp; But ever and anon you re-assert the Eucharist to be a
true sacrifice, agreeably, you say, &ldquo;to the sense of Holy
Scripture, as attested by the consent of the Church from the
beginning&rdquo; (p. 77).&nbsp; Yet no such word as
&ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; is ever mentioned, in a Eucharistic
sense, in any of the Apostolical Fathers; and an interpolation in
S. Ignatius shows how much this deficiency of evidence was
afterwards felt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without the bishop, baptize not
[neither offer nor present sacrifice], nor make a feast of
love&rdquo; (Smyrn. 8).&nbsp; You extenuate the same significant
absence of the word &ldquo;priest,&rdquo; which is never applied
by those Fathers to any church minister, by telling us (p. 66),
that Mr. Carter informs you that the omission is satisfactorily
accounted for by the smallness of their extant writings,
extending, he says, over no more than thirty octavo pages.&nbsp;
You will find, however, in the Oxford edition, about 3,300 lines
of SS. Clement, Ignatius (the shorter recension), and Polycarp,
in Greek; besides some <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Latin fragments.&nbsp; This would fill
a hundred printed pages in octavo, and is just equal to the
united Gospels of S. Mark and S. John.&nbsp; Yet those most
primitive Fathers know of no such thing as a Priest, or a
Sacrifice, among the ministers and ordinances of the Church on
earth; though it is the subject upon which their compositions
almost exclusively turn, and they tell us much about
Elders.&nbsp; This hardly looks like &ldquo;the consent of the
Church from the beginning&rdquo; (p. 77).</p>
<p>But you urge that &ldquo;the doctrine was maintained
continuously for fifteen hundred years&rdquo; (p. 99); and let me
rejoin, opposed continually, upon scriptural grounds.&nbsp; Not
seventy years after the decease of S. John, the Christian
Athenagoras tells the Emperor Aurelius (Legat. 13), &ldquo;The
Framer of the Universe needs not blood, nor the fragrance of
flowers and incense; the noblest sacrifice to Him is to know
Him:&rdquo; (here we have S. Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;treasure&rdquo;)
&ldquo;offering bloodless sacrifice,&rdquo; (here is S.
Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;fruit of the lips,&rdquo;) &ldquo;and
reasonable service,&rdquo; (meaning, after S. Paul, our own
bodies.&nbsp; Rom. xii. 1.)&nbsp; But it would fill a volume were
I to trace onwards, from age to age, these Pauline streams of
thought.</p>
<p>It is true that the Church liturgies are, many of them, full
of the idea of Eucharistic sacrifice.&nbsp; But does the Church
of England, as you say <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>(p. 99), &ldquo;maintain, in her
office, the whole substance of these liturgies,&rdquo; or even
&ldquo;all their main points&rdquo;?&nbsp; Now, we will not
assume as main points any but those which are repeated in all the
principal classes, somewhat fancifully termed the liturgies of
SS. James, Mark, Peter, and John.&nbsp; And these points are
twelve; whereof seven&mdash;the <i>Sursum corda</i>,<i>
Tersanctus</i>, recital of the Institution, Prayer for the Church
on earth, Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the act of Communion, and the act
of Praise&mdash;are preserved in our English liturgy; while four
have disappeared&mdash;the Kiss, the Prayer for the descent of
the Spirit on the elements, the Prayer for the dead, and the
Mingling of the bread and wine.&nbsp; A fifth main point, the
Oblation of the elements, had disappeared as well, from ordinary
eyes, until recently discerned in a slight addition made to the
rubric in 1662: &ldquo;the Priest shall then place upon the table
. . . bread and wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not without reason did our
liturgical Reformers shake themselves clear of the whole
arrangement, and of four-twelfths of the substance of these
offices, reducing the residue to a more Scriptural type.&nbsp;
The Reformers knew the web that could be woven out of these
liturgical materials, to entangle men, not merely in your
&ldquo;perfect accordance and harmony with the doctrine of a true
propitiatory commemorative sacrifice offered up in the Eucharist
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>to
God&rdquo; (p. 104), but in other doctrine, more advanced than
you, or any man who studies the Bible, would be willing to
accept.</p>
<p>If you would suffer the Law to be your schoolmaster, instead
of these Liturgies, you would scarcely be able so much as to
imagine that the &ldquo;signs&rdquo; of the Holy Communion could,
under any circumstances, &ldquo;be effective for sinners&rsquo;
pardon through Christ&rsquo;s body broken and his blood
shed&rdquo; (p. 104).&nbsp; For you would never bring yourself to
understand how an unbloody could effect any part of the work of a
bloody sacrifice, in a matter of propitiation.&nbsp; What a
sacrificial solecism is it to speak, as you do (p. 131), of
&ldquo;an unbloody . . . propitiatory sacrifice&rdquo;!&nbsp;
Without shedding of blood is no remission of sins.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All that true and holy thing which the Church has ever
had, as Christ&rsquo;s own appointed means for the pardon of our
sins,&rdquo; is not, as you surmise (p. 131), the Eucharistic
sacrifice, but faith in the blood of Jesus.&nbsp; The Church has
never had anything else.&nbsp; Hers the faith; His the
blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord, save me,&rdquo; she prays; &ldquo;thy
faith hath saved thee,&rdquo; He replies, from age to age.&nbsp;
And her &ldquo;pure offering,&rdquo; which you correctly adduce
from Malachi (i. 11), as referable to the Eucharist, is but a
<i>mincha</i>, a bloodless meat-offering; fruit, of no use for
pardon or propitiation.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Your
reference (p. 150) to &ldquo;the Lamb slain from the foundation
of the world&rdquo; (Rev. xiii. 8), might suggest, though it does
not establish, your idea that the one offering of Himself is, in
some sense, continuous (p. 56) to the present day.&nbsp; But I
know not why the framers of our Authorized Version did not render
this passage as they rendered the same phrase when they came upon
it again, four chapters further on (Rev. xvii. 8); &ldquo;whose
names were not written from the foundation of the world in the
book of life of the Lamb that was slain.&rdquo;&nbsp; However
translated, the passage must be expounded in accordance with S.
Paul (Heb. ix. 26, 28), &ldquo;Christ was once offered, in the
end of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; And so vanishes the Sacrifice from our altars, all
but the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to the name of the
Lord.&nbsp; But have we any Altars?</p>
<p>One of your three arguments in the affirmative, taken from
Scripture, is that our Lord would not have said, &ldquo;Leave
there thy gift before the altar,&rdquo; unless we all had altars
(p. 48).&nbsp; Nor in the same strain, could you forbear to add,
would He have said, &ldquo;Cast not your pearls before
swine,&rdquo; unless we all had pearls.&nbsp; But to proceed to
your more serious proofs.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;We have an altar&rdquo; (Heb. xiii. 10) is a
strange text for you to adduce in the second place (p. 97); for
it is S. Paul&rsquo;s illustration of the fact that Christian
hearts are &ldquo;not established with meats, which do not profit
those who have been occupied therein&rdquo; (<i>v.</i> 9); as we
find in parochial experience, when a more than Scriptural
emphasis is put upon the Eucharistic bread and wine.&nbsp; The
Apostle simply observes, in the text you quote (<i>v.</i> 10),
that the ministers of the (Christian) tabernacle cannot eat, like
Jews, of their altar; because the body of the single Christian
sacrifice was, ritually speaking, wholly burnt without the
camp.&nbsp; Granting, therefore, that we have an altar, it is not
a Eucharistic one, whereof we eat.</p>
<p>And this further shows that in your third Scriptural proof (p.
45): &ldquo;Are not they which eat of the altar, partakers with
the altar?&rdquo; (1 Cor. x. 18,) no altar but the Jewish is
meant; and you should not suppress the beginning of the sentence,
&ldquo;Behold Israel after the flesh,&rdquo; but permit the
Apostle to limit his remark to Jews, as distinct from Christians,
exactly in the way he himself proposes.&nbsp; And here you come
to the end of your Scriptural arguments for altars in church.</p>
<p>Passing from Scripture, the belief of the Church is not, as
you assume (p. 53), continuous in favour of our having a ritual
altar.&nbsp; The Gentile <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>heathens blamed the early Christians
for having no altars in their churches, and the Christians
admitted the truth of the allegation.&nbsp; (Origen, c. Cels. 8.
17; Minucius Felix, Octav. 32; Arnobius, adv. Gentes, 6, 7.&nbsp;
I borrow these references from the Bishop of Chester&rsquo;s
<i>Patres Apostolici</i>.)&nbsp; The earliest meaning of
&ldquo;altar&rdquo; in a Christian sense seems derived from the
Jewish idea, that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> took equal
pleasure in the several portions of the sacrifice, whether burnt
or eaten; and that the eaters were as much his altar, as was the
altar of burnt-offering itself.&nbsp; Hence Polycarp (Phil. 4)
says the widows are an altar; and Ignatius, probably in one place
(Philad. 4), and certainly elsewhere (Trall. 7), calls the
clergy, and (Eph. 5) the congregation, the altar.&nbsp; It was
left to after ages to suggest, in the last passage, &ldquo;the
society where sacrifices are offered.&rdquo;&nbsp; But before
they admitted the propitiatory character of such sacrifices, men
had lost S. Paul&rsquo;s doctrine (Heb. xiii. 11), that <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> was a sin-offering, wholly burned
without the camp; and they had become insensible to the
incongruity of a symbolism which could imply the eating of such
an offering.&nbsp; Far from blending the idea of an altar,
whether Jewish or heathen, with that of a Christian table, as you
seem to assume that he did (p. 54), S. Paul was too learned a
ritualist not to keep them distinct.&nbsp; <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>And as the
point of comparison, throughout the passage which you discuss (1
Cor. x.), was not the offering, but the eating; as it was eating
which joined Christians to Christ, Jews to their altar, and
Gentiles to demons; S. Paul had no need to speak of a Christian
altar.&nbsp; A table was the symbol which he required, and to
that he carefully adhered.&nbsp; He certainly knew of a Christian
altar, but it was one of which neither he, nor any other servant
of the true tabernacle (Heb. viii. 2; xiii. 10), had a right to
eat; and I cannot see how you are enabled to say (p. 98),
&ldquo;of course, it is in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist
that this altar,&rdquo; on which Jesus died (Heb. xiii. 12),
&ldquo;is used, and the sacrifice made;&rdquo; after all the
pains with which the Apostle has set forth the premises which
forbid your conclusion.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; But without your Sacrifice and Altar, what becomes
of your Priest?&nbsp; &ldquo;The priesthood,&rdquo; you say (p.
6), &ldquo;is the chiefest means for applying to us the pardon of
the Cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the priesthood you also find (p. 16)
&ldquo;the appointed mode of our applying to Christ for his
intercession;&rdquo; and you indicate a danger which may arise
from shaking men&rsquo;s confidence in such opinions, &ldquo;that
they would, no doubt, begin to fail in their allegiance to the
Church, and be afraid longer to trust their <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>souls to her
teaching or her keeping&rdquo; (p. 16).&nbsp; I should recommend
such adherents to be fed on very little of S. Paul, less of our
judicious Hooker, and no Church history.&nbsp; And even could
they be thus dieted and kept, I should be inclined to question
whether they would prove worth their feed.&nbsp; Access to the
Jewish ritual would be sure to awaken their suspicions as to the
meaning of a Christian ordination.&nbsp; For who ever heard of a
real sacrificing priest of God being ordained by the imposition
of hands?&nbsp; On the contrary, when the people laid hands on
the Levites&rsquo; heads (Numb. viii. 10), it meant quite a
different thing from ordination.&nbsp; Melchisedec was not so
ordained, nor Aaron, nor any of his race, nor our Great High
Priest, though He condescended to every form of the Law for
man.&nbsp; Yet laying on of hands was well used and understood,
as conveying a divinely authorized ministry in the congregation
to such men as Joshua (Deut. xxxiv. 9), &ldquo;in whom was the
Spirit&rdquo; (Numb. xxvii 18), and the church elders and
ministers of a later age (Acts xiv. 23).&nbsp; But none of these
ordained men sacrificed as priests.</p>
<p>And now, taking up your own appeal (p. 43), &ldquo;if it be
true that a Christian priesthood and . . . these sacrificial
powers . . . remain, and must remain ever in Christ&rsquo;s
Church, what words shall describe&rdquo;&mdash;the error of
saying with S. Paul <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>(Heb. x. 26), &ldquo;there remaineth no more sacrifice
for sin,&rdquo; nothing that calls for the exercise of these
sacrificial powers in the Church.</p>
<p>But, leaving S. Paul, &ldquo;the whole sense,&rdquo; you say
(pp. 60, 77), &ldquo;and usage of the Church from the beginning
is explained and justified,&rdquo; will we but see more in
Scripture than Scripture says, and assume the existence of the
Christian priesthood.&nbsp; But your &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; is
not the very beginning.&nbsp; You omit the Apostolical Fathers
again, a generation of good men, who never mention Christian
priests.&nbsp; Perhaps you will rather commence with a later age,
and will prefer applying your theory to mitigate such lofty
flights as we find in S. Chrysostom (On the Priesthood, iii. 2):
&ldquo;When you behold the Lord sacrificed and prostrate, and the
Priest standing over the sacrifice and praying, and all stained
with that precious blood, do you then suppose you are among men,
and standing upon the earth?&rdquo;&nbsp; But why attempt to
explain or justify such perilous matter as this?&nbsp; Why admit
its eloquent author to the privilege of developing S. Paul, or
lightening the darkness of the Apostolical Fathers?&nbsp; And if
not S. Chrysostom, whom can we admit besides?&nbsp; Often do I
wonder at the artless boldness with which our homilists quote
those Nicene Fathers, whose uncertain authority is just as much
opposed to the <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Scriptures in some places, as it sustains them in
others.</p>
<p>Such variations and discrepancies must be perplexing to those
who expect to find safe guidance in the early Church.&nbsp; You
and I, however, &ldquo;are persuaded that Holy Scripture contains
sufficiently all doctrine required of necessity for eternal
salvation, through faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; And we have
determined, by God&rsquo;s grace, out of the said Scriptures to
instruct the people committed to our charge; and to teach
nothing, as required of necessity to eternal salvation, but that
which we shall,&rdquo; each of us, &ldquo;be persuaded may be
concluded and proved by the Scripture.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ordination
Vow, II.)</p>
<p>The Established Church of England knows only of the
&ldquo;lawful&rdquo; priest, whose character is evident to all
men reading Holy Scripture and ancient authors.&nbsp; He has been
spoken of from the time of the Apostles, at first by the name of
Elder, and afterwards by that of Priest; and, like every other
member of Christ, he is God&rsquo;s fellow-worker, he has a share
in Christ&rsquo;s priesthood, and he has received the Holy Ghost
for his particular ministry.</p>
<p>You truly observe (p. 94), that &ldquo;if we can discover what
are the truths which have been held always, everywhere, and by
all, we may be certain <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>we shall run into no serious error
nor perverted interpretation of Holy Scripture dangerous to our
souls.&rdquo;&nbsp; Caution, therefore, is requisite in handling
the divine words used by our Bishops for the ordination of our
lawful clergy: &ldquo;whose sins thou dost forgive, they are
forgiven; whose sins thou dost retain, they are
retained;&rdquo;&mdash;this form not having been employed always,
for we do not find our Church using it till the twelfth century;
nor everywhere, since it only appears as a prayer in the Eastern
churches; nor by all, never having been used at the ordination of
some of our most eminent pastors of non-conforming churches, who,
though not lawful ministers in our sense, have been clearly
blessed in their spiritual work.</p>
<p>We are thus reduced to interpret the form scripturally; and we
find that it has nothing in it peculiar to priests or elders,
because our Saviour first addressed it to others, as well as to
ten of the Apostles (Luke xxiv. 33, 36 = John xx. 24), but not to
S. Thomas.&nbsp; Our ordaining Bishop, in repeating it, reminds
the candidate priest of his ministry of reconciliation and
condemnation, entrusted both generally to him, as to every other
member, and likewise specially as to every other minister of the
Church.&nbsp; But not entrusted to him as to a mediating priest,
since none such, so far as we are told, were present before
Christ, <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>when first He spoke the words.&nbsp; Your
&ldquo;sacrifice by means of a priest&rdquo; (p. 53) is unknown
to S. Paul, who says, of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> only,
&ldquo;by Him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
God continually&rdquo; (Heb. xiii. 15).&nbsp; And the privilege
of forgiveness, which S. Paul exercised, he delegated, not to the
priests of the Church of Corinth, but to the whole people (2 Cor.
ii. 10).&nbsp; Even the Decretals allow that in necessity
Christian lay people may both hear confessions and absolve.&nbsp;
A layman, too, or a woman, may baptize; surely not without
remission of sins, as Bishop Jewell remarks.</p>
<p>You ask (p. 89), what our Prayer-book means by &ldquo;benefit
of absolution,&rdquo; if there be no power to absolve vested in
the priest?&nbsp; Why do you not, in this case, relinquish
&ldquo;priest,&rdquo; and adhere to the Prayer-book expression,
&ldquo;minister of God&rsquo;s Word,&rdquo; as it appears in the
passage to which you refer?&nbsp; This is not a question of power
in laying on a drastic <i>absolvo te</i>, but of skill in the use
and application of God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; Even as the Pharisees
used the word to bind heavy burdens on men, and to unbind the
fifth commandment; or as our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> used
it to unbind the law of the Sabbath and bind the law of murder;
so the Christian minister shows his might, like Apollos, in the
Scriptures.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Nor can
you bind and loose consciences with anything less tenacious than
Scripture, accurately declared and reasonably applied.&nbsp; All
theological language, except that of Scripture, breaks down under
the tension of strict use.&nbsp; Take, for instance, your own
observation (p. 107), &ldquo;the body and blood of Christ are
verily and indeed taken and received by the faithful, that is, by
the baptized Christian people; for so the word is always used, in
strict theological language.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet this strict
language, on which you rely, fails whenever the baptized happen
to be void of a lively faith, in which case &ldquo;they are in no
wise partakers of Christ&rdquo; (Article XXIX).&nbsp; Take,
again, your quotation of &ldquo;the brief but weighty saying of
Jerome, <i>Ecclesia non est</i>, <i>qu&aelig; non habet
Sacerdotes</i>&rdquo; (p. 111); which is only true when reduced
to S. Peter&rsquo;s standard (1 Peter ii. 9), &ldquo;ye are a
royal priesthood,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;kingdom of priests,&rdquo;
of the Hebrew formula (Ex. xix. 16), exactly as interpreted by
the Septuagint.&nbsp; In any other sense, Jerome&rsquo;s dogma is
liable to endless exceptions, whenever all the claims of the
Church come to be conscientiously weighed.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Power of the Keys&rdquo; is another slippery
phrase, which you introduce (p. 114) rather in the way of
suggestion than of argument.&nbsp; It means much in theological,
and little in Scriptural <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>language.&nbsp; In the latter, I read
of the keys being given to S. Peter; he used them, and what he
did with them afterwards I do not find; but the door which he
unlocked to the Jews (Acts ii. 14) and Gentiles (Acts x.) has
stood open ever since.</p>
<p>Hickes, the non-juring bishop of Thetford, was not perhaps the
worse theologian for being a schismatical intruder into the
diocese of Norwich; but to quote him page after page, as you have
done (pp. 102, 103), in your orthodox Kensington pulpit too (pp.
109, 110, 121), was a grand experiment upon the historical
predilections of your people, and a dubious addition to the
authorities in support of your view.</p>
<p>We nowhere read in Scripture, though you appear to inform us
that it was the fact (pp. 12, 86), that Jesus appeared to the
Eleven between the resurrection and his breathing on the
disciples.&nbsp; Though it is always worth while to be accurate,
I should be far from making a man an offender for a word, did not
your error, though minute, indicate a certain want of strength in
the Scriptures.&nbsp; If the divine who said
<i>r&uacute;bric&aelig;</i> for <i>rubr&iacute;c&aelig;</i>, in
the Jerusalem Chamber, could not be trusted to make a copy of
verses in praise of Convocation, far less should an inaccurate
student of Scripture venture on pulpit statements of Church
doctrine.&nbsp; Strict, constant, indefatigable reference to
those old <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Fathers, Matthew and Mark, Peter and John, James and
Paul, is the only means of keeping the younger Fathers right, and
of testing the miscellaneous coinage of terms and doctrines which
have passed current from their day to ours.&nbsp; Such coinage as
Theot&oacute;kos, for instance, which appears in the fine
argument of your closing Sermon (p. 140), never rings so truly as
the words which have met and satisfied the ear of an inspired
writer.&nbsp; The term may cover good doctrine, and it may escape
the almost profane triviality of its Latin equivalent,
<i>Deipara</i>, as well as the unreasoning coarseness of the
English &ldquo;Mother of God:&rdquo; but, take it which way you
will, it is a poor ambiguous piece of Greek, which must mean one
thing in a Christian pulpit, and another on Mount Olympus, had
Homer condescended to introduce it there.</p>
<p>Is it not refreshing to pass from the discussion into which
you venture with Calvin, who fortunately is not alive to answer
for himself, on the causes of grace (p. 118); or, again, your
thesis on the causes of salvation (p. 153), wherein you do not
mention, what the Schoolmen tell us, that most things have five
kinds of causes; and to range at large in the simplicity of the
Scriptures, which teach us that the cause of salvation is not
only <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, His life, His love, His
work, His blood; but also faith (Eph. ii. 8), hope (Rom. viii.
24), <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>grace
(Eph. ii. 5), the bath of regeneration (Tit. iii. 5), the
engrafted Word (James i. 21), the gospel minister (Rom. xi. 14),
and student (1 Tim. 16); and then, the hearer (Phil. ii. 12), his
prayers (Phil. i. 19), and penitence (2 Cor. vii. 10); cause
heaped upon cause with creative profusion, until we begin to see
that your proposal of priestly mediation, in the Eucharistic way,
as another cause of salvation, however kindly meant, is like the
offer of a church candle in broad day.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To conclude.&nbsp; I have found fault with your Sacrifice,
Altar, and Priest; but I think I can answer for it that you will
find no fault with mine.&nbsp; The Christian Sacrifice was a
sin-offering, once made eighteen centuries ago, without the gate
of Jerusalem.&nbsp; It has often since been remembered, but never
repeated.&nbsp; The Altar was of earth, the vast sin-burdened
wreck of this fallen world, so well beloved of God, which drank
up the blood.&nbsp; The Priest is <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>; but He has made no sacrifice since,
nor used an earthly altar.</p>
<p>So much for the doctrine.&nbsp; I will make you a free gift of
all the poetry which attaches to the words Sacrifice, and Altar,
and Priest, in the varied play of religious imagination and
allegorical induction.&nbsp; But we cannot build anything so
serious <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>as
the way of our acceptance with God, or the character of our
ministry in the Church, upon such frail foundations as
these.&nbsp; And if we will but avoid the inconvenient confusion
of sacrificial and Eucharistic terms, and adhere to the accurate
phraseology of Scripture, as in a great measure our Liturgy does,
we shall clear our thoughts, and expedite our conclusions, upon
the important points to which you have ably directed
attention.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
